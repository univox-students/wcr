      <ContentBlock title="What do we offer?">
        <p>We believe that most problems are easier to manage at an earlier stage. Our 
          long-standing partnerships with the college, university and Student Union (SU) 
          enable us to proactively address your welfare concerns.
        </p>
        <h2>Who can I talk to?</h2>
        <p>Please do refer to our Welfare FAQ for specific concerns. In general, you are 
          encouraged to reach out to your college advisors, as well as any college 
          faculties/staff that are responsible to specific welfare issues. If you do not 
          feel comfortable to directly contacting the college, then please contact any
